[![Mousless Development Environment](screen_780.png)](screen.png)


This is my **personal install scripts** to install my whole Mouseless Development Environment. The entry point is the file `install_sys.sh`.

If you're searching the scripts related to my book Building Your Mouseelss Development Environment, it's there: https://github.com/Phantas0s/mouseless-book-companion/tree/master/part_III/05_user_installer/arch_installer

**WARNING**: This set of script should be used for inspiration, don't run them on your system.

## Building Your Mouseless Development Environment

Switching between a keyboard and mouse costs cognitive energy. [My book will help you set up a Linux-based development environment](https://themouseless.dev) that keeps your hands on your keyboard. Take the brain power you've been using to juggle input devices and focus it where it belongs: on the things you create.

You'll learn how to write your own installation scripts too!
